# Forest_and_water
This github repository contains the data and the analysis of the impacts of reforestation and deforestation on streamflow using generalised additive modelling.  

This work was submitted as a paper to Journal of Hydrology:
R.W. Vervoort, E. Nervi, J. Alonso (2022) Factors determining how catchments respond to forest cover change. Re-analysing global data sets.   
We are currently reviewing the editor's comments and producing a vastly revised version.   

Any **released** final data, manuscript and scripts are in the **publish** branch, please use this branch for any future work. 

This work is originally inspired by:
Zhang, M. et al., 2017. A global review on hydrological responses to forest change across multiple spatial scales: Importance of scale, climate, forest type and hydrological regime. Journal of Hydrology, 546: 44-59. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.040  
We are indebted to the work the authors of this paper put into collating a significant data set in this area.

The data from Zhang et al. (2017) have been reviewed, checked an compared to other summary work, such as Filoso et al. (2017) (see paper references).  
The final dataset of the paper is in the **data** folder and is called *AllData_Catchments.xlsx*. This same data (in three tabs in the excel sheet) is repeated in the csv files.  
A notes column has been added to the data which indicates the changes and observations we made relative to the original data set from Zhang et al. (2017),  

This work was funded through project FPTA 358, Instituto Nacional de Investigacion Agropecuaria, INIA-Uruguay.
