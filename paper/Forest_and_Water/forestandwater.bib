Previous studies have suggested significant trends in rainfall, and these are amplified causing larger changes in streamflow. However, most of the previous analysis was based on annual time scales or modelled data and did not account for changes in land cover, which could interact with changes in climate. Climate data and streamflow data between 1970 and 2010 from 13 mostly forested small catchments (<250?km2) in Australia were analysed for trends. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend analysis, generalized additive mixed modelling and rainfall-runoff modelling were combined for the analysis. This indicates consistent increases in maximum temperature and varied decreases in rainfall. The streamflow in the studied catchments indicated small decreases in streamflow, which amplified observed trends in the rainfall. In general, overall decreases are much smaller than suggested in earlier research.},

   journal = {Forest Ecology and Management},
   volume = {143},
   number = {1},
   pages = {13-26},
   abstract = {There is a well-documented empirical relationship between stand age and water yield for mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forested catchments in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia. Catchments covered with old-growth stands of mountain ash yield almost twice the amount of water annually as those covered with re-growth stands aged 25 years. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic hydro-ecologic explanation for this phenomenon. We measured leaf area index (LAI), sapwood area index (SAI) and various water balance components in several mountain ash stands, ranging in age between 5 and 240 years. Sap flow measurements show that sap velocity does not vary appreciably amongst stands of different ages, but a systematic decline in SAI with age produces a concomitant decrease in stand transpiration. The decline in overstory SAI is accompanied by a decline in overstory LAI. Understory LAI increases as the overstory LAI decreases, but this layer transpires at only about 63% of the mountain ash rate on a per unit leaf area basis. Hence, while total stand LAI decreases are modest over time, the trend is for a significant decline in total stand transpiration as the forest ages. Rainfall interception also declined over time and there was some indication that interception per unit leaf area also declined. Such reductions can be explained by lesser turbulent mixing and elevated humidity around the bulk of the leaf area in the mature forest. There were small decreases in forest floor evaporation through time, though this only accounted for about 5–8% of the site water balance. Our water balance measurements agree qualitatively with empirical water yield relationships developed for mountain ash forests, though the magnitudes of change differ.},

   pages = {3520-3530},
   abstract = {Abstract Nearly half of recent decades' global forest loss occurred in the Amazon and Cerrado (tropical savanna) biomes of Brazil, known as the arc of deforestation. Despite prior analysis in individual river basins, a generalizable empirical understanding of the effect of deforestation on streamflow across this region is lacking. We frame land use change in Brazil as a natural experiment and draw on in situ and remote sensing evidence in 324 river basins covering more than 3 × 106 km2 to estimate streamflow changes caused by deforestation and agricultural development between 1950 and 2013. Deforestation increased dry season low flow by between 4 and 10 percentage points (relative to the forested condition), corresponding to a regional- and time-averaged rate of increase in specific streamflow of 1.29 mm/year2, equivalent to a 4.08 km3/year2 increase, assuming a stationary climate. In conjunction with rainfall and temperature variations, the net (observed) average increase in streamflow over the same period was 0.76 mm/year2, or 2.41 km3/year2. Thus, net increases in regional streamflow in the past half century are 58% of those that would have been experienced with deforestation given a stationary climate. This study uses a causal empirical analysis approach novel to the water sciences to verify the regional applicability of prior basin-scale studies, provides a proof of concept for the use of observational causal identification methods in the water sciences, and demonstrates that deforestation masks the streamflow-reducing effects of climate change in this region.},

   abstract = {Tree restoration is an effective way to store atmospheric carbon and mitigate climate change. However, large-scale tree-cover expansion has long been known to increase evaporation, leading to reduced local water availability and streamflow. More recent studies suggest that increased precipitation, through enhanced atmospheric moisture recycling, can offset this effect. Here we calculate how 900 million hectares of global tree restoration would impact evaporation and precipitation using an ensemble of data-driven Budyko models and the UTrack moisture recycling dataset. We show that the combined effects of directly enhanced evaporation and indirectly enhanced precipitation create complex patterns of shifting water availability. Large-scale tree-cover expansion can increase water availability by up to 6% in some regions, while decreasing it by up to 38% in others. There is a divergent impact on large river basins: some rivers could lose 6% of their streamflow due to enhanced evaporation, while for other rivers, the greater evaporation is counterbalanced by more moisture recycling. Several so-called hot spots for forest restoration could lose water, including regions that are already facing water scarcity today. Tree restoration significantly shifts terrestrial water fluxes, and we emphasize that future tree-restoration strategies should consider these hydrological effects.},

Whilst such analyses are widespread in hydrologic practice and research, attention is rarely given to the problems of heteroscedacity, seasonality, serial correlation, and non-normally distributed variates. Each of these problems can potentially invalidate the basic assumptions upon which traditional statistical methods are based. We describe methods to contend with some of these problems and apply them to mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forested catchments in the Maroondah Basin, south-eastern Australia. A seasonal regression model with lag-one auto-regressive (AR1) error was developed to predict monthly streamflow at treated catchments based on streamflow data from a control catchment. It is particularly well-suited to situations where little pre-treatment data is available. Differences between observed and predicted streamflow were used to quantify the effect of forest treatment on streamflow. Results from two catchment groups broadly matched the trend predicted by a previous regional model, with 2–3 year increases in streamflow, followed by decreases over the following one or two decades. A third group of catchments also showed initial increases, but expected subsequent decreases in streamflow were offset by the flow-increasing effects of insect infestations.},

   abstract = {Water yields increased after logging by 150-250 mm per year in small catchments of moist old-growth eucalypt at Karuah in central New South Wales. The magnitude of this initial increase was directly related to the percentage of the catchment logged (29-79%). Where substantial vegetation removal took place in less than 20% of one catchment no increased water yield was observed. Water yields began to decline in all catchments 2-3 years after logging as regrowth eucalypts became established, and the rate of this decline was related to the mean stocking rate of eucalypt regeneration during the next 4 years. This water yield decline exceeded 250 mm in the sixth year after logging in the catchment with the highest stocking of regeneration and the highest regrowth basal area. Water yields in this catchment had declined to levels significantly below pre-logging levels by this time, supporting the notion that regrowth evapotranspiration had begun to exceed that of the old-growth forest. Patterns of declining water yield in the other catchments suggest that yields in some may also decline below pre-logging levels as regrowth evapotranspiration increases in line with increases in the basal area of the regrowth forest. Further study is required to determine the magnitude and duration of water yield reductions in these regrowth catchments, and to quantify the eucalypt growth rates and stand conditions responsible for the reductions. Nevertheless, these early results are consistent with water yield changes observed in mountain ash forest in Victoria, and support the concept of greater water use by a rapidly regenerating forest.},

   abstract = {Water yields in a regrowth eucalypt forest were found to increase initially and then to decline below pre-treatment levels during the 16-year period which followed the logging of a moist old-growth eucalypt forest in Eastern Australia. Both regrowth and old-growth stands were dominated by Sydney Blue Gum (Eucalyptus saligna Smith) and Silvertop Stringybark (Eucalyptus laevopinea R. Baker). Using a paired-catchment approach we observed significant reductions in five of six gauged catchments, and were able to associate their magnitude with forest growth rate, canopy cover and soil depth. Regular yield declines were interrupted for a period in some catchments, possibly due to foliar insect attack. Yield reductions of up to a maximum 600 mm per year in logged and regenerated areas were in accord with water yield reductions observed in Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans F.J. Muell.) regeneration in Victoria. This study therefore represents the first confirmation of these Maroondah Mountain Ash results in another forest type that has also undergone eucalypt-to-eucalypt succession. Baseflow analysis indicated that baseflow and stormflow both increased after logging, with stormflow increases dominant in catchments with shallower soils. The lower runoff observed when the regenerating forest was aged 13-16 years was principally a consequence of lower baseflow.},

   abstract = {Summary The Coalburn research catchment (1.5km2) in Kielder Forest, Northern England, is a long-term project to study the effect of upland afforestation on hydrology. There is now a unique 45-year record; making it Britain’s longest running forest hydrology research catchment. The site was instrumented in 1967, ploughed and planted in 1972/73 and the trees have now reached maturity. Hourly meteorological data have been measured since 1993 and these have enabled hydrological simulations to be carried out using the Shetran model for the period 1993–2011. The results from this work show that after ploughing there was an increase of around 50–100mm in annual streamflow compared with the original upland grassland vegetation. However, the mature trees now show a decrease of around 250–300mm in the annual streamflow compared with the original vegetation and a decrease of around 350mm in the annual streamflow compared with when the site was ploughed. The simulation results show very clearly the non-stationary nature of the catchment during 1993–2011 with an annual increase in intercepted evaporation and a decrease in discharge as the trees grow. Simulation results also show that peak discharges are higher for a cover of smaller trees compared with taller trees. However, the results suggest that the bigger the event the smaller is the difference, i.e. there is absolute convergence for the two different tree scenarios at higher discharges. The study shows how modelling can compensate for data deficiencies, to maximise outcomes. As a rare example of long-term analysis of non-stationary catchment behaviour it also provides real evidence of change that would otherwise have had to be inferred theoretically.},

   abstract = {Abstract Streamflows were measured in two Pinus radiata plantation catchments and one native eucalypt forest catchment in Canobolas State forest from 1999 to 2007. In 2002/2003, clearfall harvesting of 43·2 and 40·3% of two plantation catchments occurred, respectively. Water yields increased by 54 mm (52%), 71 mm (35%) and 50 mm (19%) in the first three years post-harvest in treated catchment A and by 103 mm (118%), 157 mm (82%) and 119 mm (48%) in treated catchment B relative to the native forest control catchment. In the fourth post-harvest water year annual rainfall was only 488 mm, which resulted in negligible run-off in all catchments, regardless of forest cover. In both plantation catchments, monthly streamflows increased significantly (p = 0·01, p < 0·001) due to a significant increase in baseflows (p < 0·001) after harvesting. Monthly stormflows were not significantly affected by harvesting. Flow duration curve analyses indicated a variable response between the two plantation catchments. Treated catchment A was converted from an ephemeral stream flowing 42% of the time pre-harvest to a temporary stream flowing 82% of the time post-harvest. These changes occurred throughout all seasons of the year but were most pronounced during summer and autumn when baseflows were maintained post-harvest but were not observed under native forest or mature pine plantations. By contrast, flow duration increased in treated catchment B from 12% of the time pre-harvest to 38% of the time post-harvest with the greatest changes measured during the winter and spring months when streamflow would normally occur under native forest conditions. These observations have important implications for the development of models of plantation water use to be utilized in water resource planning in Australia. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   volume = {306},
   pages = {107-117},
   abstract = {Eucalypts are commonly planted hardwoods worldwide and Eucalyptus dominated forests naturally grow in the headwaters of many Australian water supply catchments. The hydrological effects of disturbances have been extensively reported for one species, E. regnans (Mountain Ash). The typical response to disturbance is unusual in that following an initial increase, with heavy seed dispersal and rapid regeneration, streamflow from these forests is greatly reduced. In New South Wales (NSW), native forests are dominated by different Eucalyptus species that typically grow in mixed-species and mixed-age stands that regenerate less vigorously. In this study the long term streamflow records from the six Yambulla catchments in southeastern NSW were analysed to assess the relative effects of wildfires, integrated logging operations and subsequent mixed species eucalypt forest regeneration on catchment hydrology. In all five treated catchments an increase in total streamflow, baseflow and stormflow was detected following the 1979 wildfire and/or integrated logging activities that occurred at various intervals. A subsequent reduction of streamflow to below that of a mature stand was not detected in three of the catchments but was detected in the two that had been subjected to integrated logging followed by a wildfire, and a wildfire followed by salvage logging, respectively. The reduction, however, was minor and short-lived in each case meaning that overall there was a cumulative increase in streamflow in the post-disturbance period. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that catchment-scale hydrological responses to disturbance of mixed species eucalypt forests do not follow the unusual response often reported in wet Mountain Ash forests. This has important implications for the modelling and management of mixed species eucalypt hydrology.},

   abstract = {Summary Competition for water resources in Australia’s Murray Darling Basin has resulted in plans to account for water used by various land use change activities including plantation forests. To date generalised forest conversion models have been used to assess the likely impacts of future afforestation. These models are a useful starting point but do not account for forest age or silvicultural intervention such as thinning. A twenty year record from the Red Hill paired catchment study was analysed to show that forest age is a significant factor in determining the streamflow response to afforestation. Compared to the Kileys Run pasture catchment, streamflow in the Red Hill catchment afforested with Pinus radiata plantations steadily declined, particularly after age 6years when stand basal area rapidly increased. Mixed effect model analysis indicated that over the first 20years of the rotation the mean annual impact of afforestation with pines was 155mm. The modelled impact peaked at 211mm in year 14 prior to thinning. Thinning at age 14years had a significant positive effect on streamflow that has persisted for at least 6years. Drought conditions coupled with a process of recharging the catchment soils contributed to a delayed response to thinning. Factors such as forest age and thinning should be incorporated into models used in water resources planning to more accurately predict the hydrological effects of afforestation.},

   number = {1–2},
   pages = {94-109},
   abstract = {There is much debate about the role of plantation forestry in southeast Australia in helping control stream salinity and in exacerbating stream flow reductions. We reviewed modelling tools developed to plan forestry for surface water and salinity outcomes and tested three of these in a multi-scale study within the Murray-Darling Basin, to assess the impact of plantation forestry on water availability; whether these impacts are counterbalanced by stream salinity benefits; and to what extent spatial planning can optimise this trade-off. Comparison with stream flow data suggested that in medium rainfall areas (600–1000 mm year−1) runoff generation from agricultural land is very similar to that of forested land, implying that reforestation in these regions would have a limited stream flow impact. The estimated reduction in total surface water resources across the basin due to future plantation expansion was estimated at &lt;0.3% by 2020. Plantation expansion was not predicted to alter flow regime in large catchments, but may do so in catchments smaller than ∼2000 km2. Spatial planning is likely to increase the effectiveness of reforestation against stream salinity by more than seven times. The limited availability of suitable areas and the relatively small impact per hectare planted appear to rule reforestation out as an effective way to reduce stream salinity in the Murray River. Reforestation can help to reduce stream salt exports from smaller catchments, but reductions in both average stream salinity and high salinity events may be difficult to achieve. The available models generally allow us to arrive at these conclusions with a reasonable degree of confidence, but the cause(s) of the lower than expected runoff generation on agricultural land remains an outstanding question.},

   abstract = {Precipitation over land partitions into runoff via surface water and groundwater (blue water) and evapotranspiration (green water). We expand the traditional debate on water scarcity, which solely focuses on blue water, by assessing green water scarcity. The current debate on water scarcity is heavily skewed, since it leaves unnoticed the bulk of water availability––which is green––and the bulk of water use––which is also green. Green water is the main source of water to produce food, feed, fiber, timber, and bioenergy. Thus, to understand how freshwater scarcity constrains the production of these vital goods, explicating and including (limits to) green water use is imperative. Green water––rainfall over land that eventually flows back to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration––is the main source of water to produce food, feed, fiber, timber, and bioenergy. To understand how freshwater scarcity constrains production of these goods, we need to consider limits to the green water footprint (WFg), the green water flow allocated to human society. However, research traditionally focuses on scarcity of blue water––groundwater and surface water. Here we expand the debate on water scarcity by considering green water scarcity (WSg). At 5 × 5 arc-minute spatial resolution, we quantify WFg and the maximum sustainable level to this footprint (WFg,m), while accounting for green water requirements to support biodiversity. We then estimate WSg per country as the ratio of the national aggregate WFg to the national aggregate WFg,m. We find that globally WFg amounts to 56% of WFg,m, and overshoots it in several places, for example in countries in Europe, Central America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The sustainably available green water flows in these countries are mostly or fully allocated to human activities (predominately agriculture and forestry), occasionally at the cost of green water flows earmarked for nature. By ignoring limits to the growing human WFg, we risk further loss of ecosystem values that depend on the remaining untouched green water flows. We emphasize that green water is a critical and limited resource that should explicitly be part of any assessment of water scarcity, food security, or bioenergy potential.},

   abstract = {Abstract Our aim was to quantify the effects of forest plantation and management (clear cut or 30% partial harvest) in relation to pasture, on catchment discharge in southeast Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. A paired-catchment approach was implemented in two regions (Eldorado do Sul and São Gabriel municipalities) where discharge was measured for 4 years at three catchments in each region, two of which were predominantly eucalypt plantation (mainly Eucalyptus saligna, rotation of approximately 7–9 years) with native forest and grass in streamside zones. The third catchment was covered with grazed pasture. Weather, soils, canopy interception, groundwater level, tree growth, and leaf area index were also measured. The 3-PG process-based forest productivity model was adapted to predict spatial daily plantation and pasture water balance including precipitation interception, soil evaporation, transpiration, soil moisture, drainage, discharge, and monthly plantation growth. The TOPMODEL framework was used to simulate water pools and fluxes in the catchments. Discharge was higher under pasture than pre-harvesting plantation and increased for 1–2 years after complete plantation harvest; this change was less pronounced in the catchments under partial harvest. The ratio of discharge to precipitation before harvesting varied from 7% to 13% in the eucalypt catchments and 28% to 29% under pasture. The ratio increases to 23–24% after total harvest, and to 17% after partial harvesting. The ratio under pasture also increases during this period (to 32–44%) owing to increased precipitation. The baseflow, in relation to total discharge, varied from 28% to 62% under Eucalyptus and from 38% to 43% in the pasture catchments. Hence, eucalypt plantations in these regions can be expected to influence discharge regimes when compared with pasture land use, and modelling suggests that partial harvesting would moderate the magnitude of discharge variation compared with a full catchment plantation harvesting. The model efficiency coefficient (Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient) varied from 0.665 to 0.799 for the total period of the study. Simulation of alternative harvesting scenarios suggested that at least 20% of the catchment planted area must be harvested to increase discharge. This model could be a useful practical tool in various plantation forestry contexts around the world. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, the effects of plantations on water resources are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of Eucalyptus sp. plantations on water budget fluxes in the southern Brazilian grasslands biome. We evaluated green (canopy interception and evapotranspiration) and blue (discharge) water flows in three watersheds: two watersheds predominantly covered with eucalyptus, either in the first years after planting or at the end of the rotation, and one watershed with livestock-grazing grassland. We used field measurements of rainfall, streamflow, and throughfall and estimated canopy interception and evapotranspiration by water balance. Water flows in the monitored watersheds with eucalyptus plantations were influenced by forest developmental stage. Annual canopy interception and transpiration were always higher in the watersheds with eucalyptus than in the one with grassland, except for the transpiration in the first year after plantation in the watershed with young eucalyptus. An increase in evapotranspiration (green water flow) and the consequent decrease in streamflow (blue water flow) should be considered in local water resource management. Studies of catchment hydrology and forest management for improved water use efficiency and streamflow regulation are needed, particularly in understudied regions.},

   abstract = {A catchment study was conducted between January 1990 and April 1992 to quantify the impact of harvesting a mature Pinus caribaea plantation forest on total runoff, baseflow recession, peak discharge, stormflow volume and sediment concentration. As rainfall differed between pre- and post-harvesting periods, a streamflow prediction model (HBV) and statistical methods were used to evaluate observed changes and to test if these were significant. Most runoff occurred as baseflow (64–74% of total runoff). Baseflow increased significantly after harvesting, from 10% to 16% of rainfall. The minimum daily flow increased by 70% after harvesting, in spite of lower rainfall in that period. Stormflow volumes and peak discharges also increased significantly as a result of Horton overland flow generation on new road and log-landing surfaces and a higher wetness of the catchment due to lower evapotranspiration. Stormflow volume doubled from 2.7% to 5.5% of rainfall after harvesting. The combined effect amounted to estimated increases in flows from 252 mm under forest to 580 mm after harvesting for the 324-days period of 1990 (total rainfall of 1613 mm) and from 90 mm to 194 mm for the drier 309-days period in 1991/1992 (total rainfall of 992 mm). Sediment concentrations increased significantly during stormflow events after harvesting, but not under baseflow conditions. Harvesting of the pine plantation therefore increased stormflow, baseflow and total water yield significantly. Stormflow water quality was affected negatively, though, through increased sediment concentrations. These aspects are important for water resources management considerations related to plantation forestry in areas with a distinct dry season.},

   abstract = {Abstract South America is experiencing rapid change in forest cover, of both native and planted forest. Forest cover loss is primarily attributable to fire, logging, and conversion of native forest to agriculture, pasture, and forest plantations, and types of change vary within and among the many diverse types of forests in South America. Major changes in forest cover and growing policy concerns underscore an urgent need for research on sustainable forest management and water ecosystem services in South America. Differences in land ownership and management objectives create trade-offs between wood production and water ecosystem services from forests. Work is needed to quantify how forest change and management affect ecosystem services, such as wood production versus water provision. Current scientific understanding of forest management effects on water ecosystem services in South America has important limitations, including a scarcity of long-term records and few long-term integrated watershed studies. Industry, government, universities, and local communities should collaborate on integrated applied studies of forests and water. Data archiving and publically available data are required. The creation of national networks and a multi-country South America network to identify and implement common water research protocols, share results, and explore their implications would promote common and well-supported policies. Hydrologists working in South America are well placed to tackle the challenges and opportunities for collaborative research that will maintain the intrinsic values and water ecosystem services provided by South America's forests.},

   abstract = {Summary Wildfire is a recurring event which has been acknowledged by the literature to impact the hydrological cycle of a catchment. Hence, wildfire may have a significant impact on water yield levels within a catchment. In Australia, studies of the effect of fire on water yield have been limited to obligate seeder vegetation communities. These communities regenerate from seed banks in the ground or within woody fruits and are generally activated by fire. In contrast, the Sydney Basin is dominated by obligate resprouter communities. These communities regenerate from fire resistant buds found on the plant and are generally found in regions where wildfire is a regular occurrence. The 2001/2002 wildfires in the Sydney Basin provided an opportunity to investigate the impacts of wildfire on water yield in a number of catchments dominated by obligate resprouting communities. The overall aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a difference in water yield post-wildfire. Four burnt subcatchments and 3 control subcatchments were assessed. A general additive model was calibrated using pre-wildfire data and then used to predict post-wildfire water yield using post-wildfire data. The model errors were analysed and it was found that the errors for all subcatchments showed similar trends for the post-wildfire period. This finding demonstrates that wildfires within the Sydney Basin have no significant medium-term impact on water yield.},

   journal = {Journal of Hydrology},
   volume = {590},
   pages = {125387},
   abstract = {Streamflow (Q) change is simultaneously driven by climate-induced changes and various human activities. To understand their respective roles, a large number of partitioning studies were conducted. However, each of the scattered case studies may only provide local-to-regional understanding of the contributions from climate-induced changes and human-induced changes to streamflow variations over various study periods. To address if it is possible to reveal the relative contribution of climate-induced changes (dQ_CIC) and human-induced changes (dQ_HIC) from the spatially distributed case studies, and then to predict regional to global spatial pattern of streamflow changes due to climate-induced changes, we reviewed 103 studies providing access to 1321 catchment cases, and performed a meta-analysis which characterized how that population varied with the number of catchment cases per study and the length of study period, and analyzed if and to what extent the bias of that population was influenced by various study factors. Possible catchment streamflow change, relative to the 1960s−2000s, was projected for the 2040s–2060s. Our meta-analysis suggested that, over the past decades, total streamflow change (i.e. dQ_Tot), on average, was −11.9 mm.a−1, and streamflow changes due to dQ_CIC and dQ_HIC were + 3.6 ± 48.1 mm.a−1 and −15.5 ± 44.4 mm.a−1, respectively. We also found that several study factors including catchment size, partitioning method, and climate type (mainly mean annual precipitation) were not important sources of bias for the meta-analysis, as they each only explained a small portion of the variability in dQ_CIC or dQ_HIC. Although study periods of the case studies and climate oscillation influenced the magnitude and direction of dQ_CIC (and dQ_HIC), dQ_CIC showed a strongly temporal invariant dependence on dP, with a ratio of 0.48 for the fitted linear line (p < 0.05). The mean changing rate of dQ_CIC (i.e. dQ_CIC/dt) over the past decades was +0.07 ± 4.13 mm.a−2. Our study heightened the imperative to perform analysis with respect to the spatial variation of dQ response to climate perturbations and/or variation across various regions, and to disentangle hydrological contribution of interactions/feedbacks between climate-induced change and land-use/land-cover changes from the other anthropogenic changes in future partitioning studies for a better understanding of dQ response to climate-induced change.},

   abstract = {Intensively managed plantations account for 1.5% of the world’s forests, but they meet one-third of the demand for wood products. Eucalyptus plantations are among the most productive, with rates of growth depending heavily on genetics, silviculture, and climate. The TECHS Project examines productivity at 36 locations across a 3500km gradient from Brazil to Uruguay, testing the interacting influences of genetics, temperature and precipitation on stemwood production. Across all sites and genotypes, stemwood production in the middle of the 6-year rotation (the peak period of growth) averaged 22Mgha−1yr−1. Production varied by fivefold across sites, and by about 2-fold among genotypes within each site. The best clones at each location grew 1.5–4Mgha−1yr−1 more than the average for all clones, underscoring the importance of matching genotypes to local site conditions. Contrary to patterns for natural forests across geographic gradients, Eucalyptus production declined with increasing temperature, dropping by 2.5Mgha−1yr−1 for a 1°C temperature increase. The temperature effect was likely driven in part by the geographic covariance of temperature and rainfall, as rainfall tended to decline by 78mmyr−1 for each 1°C increase in temperature. Stemwood production increased an average of 1.5Mgha−1yr−1 for each 100mmyr−1 increase in precipitation, but when the covariation of temperature and precipitation were included the apparent influence of precipitation declined to 0.4Mgha−1yr−1 for each 100mmyr−1 increase in precipitation. Future results will determine if within-site reductions in ambient rainfall have the same apparent influences as the rainfall pattern across the geographic gradient, as well as quantifying the importance of insects and pests in affecting growth. The supply of wood from intensively managed plantations will be strongly influenced by both temperature and precipitation at plantation locations, and with changing climates.},

   abstract = {Abstract The effects of forest cover change on water yield have long been studied across the globe. Several reviews have summarized the impacts of forest change and water yield from the small and paired watershed experiments, but no any synthetic assessment has been conducted on the basis of studies of large watersheds (>1,000 km2). We conducted a synthetic analysis on the basis of the studies from 162 large studied watersheds across the globe to explore how forest cover change affects annual water yield. Our first-ever assessment confirms that deforestation increases annual water yield and reforestation decreases it, which is consistent with results from paired watershed experiments. More importantly, we found that forest cover and climate variability play a coequal role in annual water yield variations. The effects of forest cover change and climate variability on annual water yield variations can be additive or offsetting. Thus, their interactions can critically determine the magnitudes and directions of water yield changes. We also found that the hydrological sensitivities to forest cover change in smaller and dryer watersheds are higher than those in larger and wetter ones. The implications of these findings for sustainable water and watershed management are discussed in the context of future land cover and climate changes.},

   abstract = {A small (344ha) experimental catchment in southwest Western Australia was partially deforested (western 53% of the catchment) in 1976 to study the effects of agricultural development on water quantity and quality. The impact on the groundwater system in the cleared area was dramatic. Initial rates of rise were only 0.11 m year−1 but this increased after 10 years to average 2.3 m year−1. Groundwater rises of 15 m in the valley and 20–25 m on the lower sideslopes were observed over 13 years. A small seep (groundwater discharge area) appeared for the first time in 1988 and by 1989 it covered an area of 1 ha. Streamflow initially increased by 30 mm year−1 (4.0% rainfall) compared with a native forest average streamflow of 8 mm year−1 (1.0% rainfall). However, since the seep area developed, the increase in streamflow has been 50 mm year−1 (6.6% rainfall). Stream salinity was low prior to clearing (30 mgl−1Cl−) and remained low for 9 years after clearing. However, since 1987, stream salinity increased dramatically as the ground water approached the ground surface, and by 1989 reached an annual average of 290 mgl−1Cl−. The daily maximum in 1989 was 2200 mgl−1Cl− compared with 92 mgl−Cl− from 1976 to 1986. The catchment changed from net salt accumulation pre-clearing to net salt export after 1987. Thirteen years after clearing, the groundwater level, stream yield, stream salt load and stream salinity had not reached equilibrium but were all still increasing.},

   abstract = {The clearing of native vegetation and establishement of agricultural plants on a small catchment in southwest Western Australia resulted in a large streamflow increase (∼30% rainfall yr−1). This increase was brought about by a decrease in transpiration and interception loss. Streamflow increased markedly in the first year after clearing (∼10% rainfall) and continued to increase at a slower rate for a further five years, when a new streamflow equilibrium was reached. Explanations of the time trend of streamflow increase were sought in terms of streamflow generation mechanisms. The initial increase in streamflow was attributed to the impact of the immediate decrease in interception loss (∼13% of rainfall). The subsequent linear increase in streamflow was closely correlated with the expansion of the groundwater discharge area, and the cessation of streamflow increase was considered to result from the attainment of a new groundwater recharge-discharge equilibrium. Evidence from other catchments which have undergone forest reduction show that the permanent groundwater system is instrumental in controlling the streamflow response following forest reduction.},

   abstract = {Abstract Two small experimental catchments were established in the south-west of Western Australia to study the effects of logging and subsequent regeneration on the mechanism of streamflow generation. Following a six year pre-treatment calibration period (1976–1981), one catchment (March Road) was logged and reforested in 1982 and the other (April Road South) remained as a control. Logging resulted in an increase in groundwater levels and subsequently groundwater discharge area. The deep, permanent groundwater levels in the valley and upslope areas rose until 1986 and then began to decline. The maximum rise was 5 m in the upslope areas. The duration of shallow, intermittent groundwater system, perched on underlying clay, was extended from 2–3 months in winter before logging to 5–6 months after logging. The shallow groundwater level rose in the valley and began to discharge at the ground surface in 1986. Logging resulted in an increase in streamflow. The maximum increase (≈18% of annual rainfall) was in 1983, one year after logging. The increase in streamflow was due to a substantial decrease in interception and evapotranspiration, increased recharge to the shallow groundwater system, decreased soil moisture deficit and consequently an increase in throughflow. The increase in base flow was about twice that of quick flow. The changes in streamflow and its components in the subsequent years were closely related to the groundwater discharge area. Most of the quick flow was generated as saturation excess overland flow from the groundwater discharge area in the valley. The expansion of the groundwater discharge area, increased soil moisture content, higher groundwater level and the presence of the shallow groundwater system for the extended periods were responsible for the process of streamflow generation.},

   abstract = {Abstract Two large neighbouring watersheds, the Bowron (3420 km2) and Willow (2860 km2) situated in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada, were used to compare their hydrological responses to forest harvesting in snow-dominant environment. Both watersheds had experienced significant, comparative forest harvesting level. The long-term hydrometric and timber harvesting data (>50 years of records) were analysed using time series analysis to examine the hydrological impacts of forest harvesting. The hydrological variables including mean, peak and low flows over annual and seasonal scales (spring snowmelt, summer rain and winter base flow) were tested separately. Results showed that forest harvesting in the Willow watershed significantly increased annual and spring mean flows as well as annual and spring peak flows, whereas it caused an insignificant change on those hydrological variables in the Bowron watershed. The contrasted differences in hydrological responses are due to the differences in topography, spatial heterogeneity, forest harvesting characteristics and climate between two watersheds. The relative uniform topography and climate in the Willow watershed may promote hydrological synchronization effects, whereas larger variation in elevations, together with forest harvesting that occurred at lower elevations, may cause hydrological de-synchronization effect in the Bowron watershed. The contrasted results demonstrate that the effects of forest harvesting on hydrology in large watersheds are likely watershed specific, and any attempt to generalize hydrological responses to forest harvesting must be carried out with caution. A landscape ecological perspective is critically needed for future forest hydrology studies, particularly for large watersheds. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Understanding the combined effect of climate and landuse change on water is essential for developing sustainable water resources plans. Most studies consider only the isolated effect of climate alone or landuse alone, and this could skew the picture of hydrologic responses by attributing too little or too much importance to climate or landuse change. Quantifying the combined impact of climate and landuse change is a significant challenge as water yield is the convolution of both these factors. This paper briefly reviews key literature on quantifying climate and landuse change impacts on water yield with an emphasis on the framework developed over the last decade. We discuss the assumptions embedded in the framework and the potential for predicting climate and landuse impact on future water yield.},
