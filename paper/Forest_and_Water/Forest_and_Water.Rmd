Introduction
==========================

## Introduction

There has been an long and on-going discussion in the hydrologcal literature around the impact of forests on streamflow [@andreassian2004; @jackson2005; @zhang2017; @brown2005; @brown2013]. The historic work highlights provides a general consensus that if forest areas increase, streamflow decreases and vice-versa. The most dramatic result in relation to this, is Figure 5 in @zhang2011 indicating (or Australian watersheds) a 100% decrease in stream flow for watersheds with 100% forest cover. However, on the other end of the spectrum, in a series of French watersheds [@cosandey2005], there was no change in streamflow characteristics in 2 of the three watersheds studied in relation to deforestation.

There have been several review papers aiming to summarize different studies across the globe, in relation to paired watershed studies [@brown2005; @hewlett1984] and more generally [@jackson2005; @zhang2017]. These studies are aiming to generalize the individual findings and to identify if there are global trends or relationships that can be developed. The most recent review [@zhang2017] developed an impressive database of watershed studies in relation to changes in streamflow due to changes in forest cover based on a global data set. This dataset, which covers over 250 studies are described in terms of the change in streamflow as a result of the change in forest cover, where studies related to both forestation (increase in forest cover) and deforestation (decrease in forest cover) were included.

The conclusions of the paper [@zhang2017] suggest that there is a distinct difference in the change in flow as a result of forestation or deforestation between small watersheds, defined as < 1000 km^2^ and large watersheds > 1000 km^2^. While for small watersheds there was no real change in runoff with changes in cover, for large watersheds there was a clear trend showing a decrease in runoff with and increase in forest cover. Their main conclusion was that the response in annual runoff to forest cover was scale dependent and appeared to be more sensitive to forest cover change in water limited watersheds relative to energy limited watershed [@zhang2017].

Encouraged by the work presented by @zhang2017 and the fantastic database of studies presented by these authors, we believe we can add to the discussion by presenting further analysis of the data and by adding further watersheds and enhancements to the data base. 

In particular, the main method in the work by @zhang2017 is using simple linear regression. And the main assumption is that the threshold at 1000 km^2^ is a distinct separation between "small" and "large" watersheds. Given the fantastic data set collected, the analysis can be easily expanded to look at interactions between the terms and to test the assumption of a distinct threshold at 1000 km^2^.

In particular, the objective of this paper is to 1) enhance the data set from @zhang2017 with further watersheds and spatial coordinates and 2) to analyse the possibility of non-linear and partial effects of the different factors and variables in the data base using generalised linear (GLM) and generalised additive models (GAM @wood2006). Finally we hope to point to further research that can expand our work and that outlined @zhang2017 to better understand the impact of forest cover change on streamflow.

Methods
==========

## The original data set

The starting point of this paper is the data base of studies which were included in @zhang2017 as supplementary material. The columns in this data set are the watershed number, the	watershed name, the	Area in km^2^, the annual average precipitation	(Pa) in mm, the	forest type, hydrological regime, and climate type, the change in forest cover	in % ($\Delta$F%) and the change in streamflow in % ($\Delta$Qf(%), based on equation 1 in @zhang2017), the precipitation data type, the assessment technique, and the	source of the info, which is a citation. 
Several of these columns contain abbreviations to describe the different variables, which are summarised in Table 1.


Table 1  Summary of abbreviations of factors used in the @zhang2017 data set

|Factor | Abbreviation | Definition |
|:------------|:-------|:----------|
| forest type | CF |coniferous forest | 
|  | BF | broadleaf forest |
|  | MF |mixed forest  |
|hydrological regime|RD|rain dominated|
| |SD|snow dominated|
| climate type| EL| energy limited|
| |WL| water limited|
| |EQ| equitant|
|precipitation data type|OB|observed|
| |SG|spatial gridded|
| |MD|modelled|
|assessment technique|PWE|paired watershed experiment|
| |QPW|quasi-paired watershed experiment|
| |HM|hydrological modelling|
| |EA|elastictity analysis|
| |SH|combined use of statistical methods|
| | |and hydrographs|

While the @zhang2017 use the dryness index in their analysis, potential or reference evapotranspiration is not part of the data set.
We combined the tables for small (< 1000 km^2^) and large (>= 1000 km^2^) watreshed data sets in our analysis. Some small naming errors and citations for some of the data sets for some of the small watersheds were fixed as we were familiar with the studies. But overall the original data set was not changed.

## Additional data collection

To enhance the existing data set, this study added additional variables. The first variables added were the latitude and longitude for the center of the watershed as an approximation of its spatial location. Using this information  annual average reference evapotranspiration (E0) was extracted from **XXXXX** if value of E0 were not available from the original papers. For large water watersheds, this value, similar to annual average rainfall, is an approximation of the climate at the location. 

The length of the study can be a variable influencing the change in flow [e.g. @jackson2005] and therefore, the length of the different studies was extracted from the references provided by @zhang2017.

Several additional data points from watershed studies were extracted from @zhang2011, @zhao2010, @borg1988, @thornton2007, @zhou2010, @rodriguez2010, @ruprechtetal1991 and @pena-arancibia2012, and these were checked against the existing studies to prevent overlap. In the citation column in the data set, in general the main reference for the calculated change in streamflow  was used, because sometimes the original study did not provide the quantification of the change in streamflow (i.e. Table 6 in @zhang2011)

The final column in the improved data set is a "notes" column, which is not further used in the analysis, but gives context to some of the data for future research.

## Statistical modelling

To estimate how the change in streamflow is affected by the change in forest cover while considering the effects of the other variables, we applied generalised additive modelling (GAM) [@wood2006]. In particular we fitted the following initial model to replicate the variables in the analysis from @zhang2017:  


$$\tag{1}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \%Q \sim ~&\Delta \%forest + s(Pa) + s(Area) +  {forest~type} + \\  &{climate~type} + {assessment~type} + {hydrologic~regime} + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}$$

However, the overall skewed distribution of the predictant ($\Delta \%Q$) is problematic, and this results in a skewed distribution of the GAM model residuals. As a result we transformed $\Delta \%Q$ and $\Delta \%forest$ back to fractions (0 - 1) and log transformed using $log10(x + 1)$, where $x$ is either $\Delta Q$ or $\Delta forest$. This means that the model residuals are $\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ results in the following equation: 


$$\tag{2}
\begin{aligned}
log10(\Delta Q) \sim ~&log10(\Delta forest) + s(Pa, k = 3) + s(Area, k = 3) +  {forest~type} + \\  &{climate~type} + {assessment~type} + {hydrologic~regime} + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}$$


In this model, the assumption is that all continuous variables (such as Pa) can have a linear or non-linear relationship with $log10(\Delta Q)$. This means that a smooth function $s()$ is applied to the variable. To restrict the smoothness of the fit, the smoothness factor $k$ is restricted to a value of 3 [@wood2006]. This restriction was applied to smooth variables throughout this paper and we have dropped this from the subsequent equations.

For the model in equation 2, we only used the data from @zhang2017 to make sure that the additional watersheds added to the data set did not influence the analysis. Given that in @zhang2017, dryness ($\frac{E0}{Pa}$) is used to look at variations in the change in flow, we also fitted the following model:

$$\tag{3}
\begin{aligned}
log10(\Delta Q) \sim ~&log10(\Delta forest) + s(\frac{E0}{Pa}) + s(Area) +  {forest~type} + \\  &{climate~type} + {assessment~type} + {hydrologic~regime} + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}$$

Subsequently, using the full data set, including the additional watersheds and the additional variables the following two models were fitted:

$$\tag{4}
\begin{aligned}
log10(\Delta Q) \sim ~&log10(\Delta forest) + s(Pa) + s(Area) + s(Latitude) + s(Longitude) + \\
& s(years) + {forest~type} + {climate~type} + {assessment~type} + \\ & {hydrologic~regime} + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}$$

$$\tag{5}
\begin{aligned}
log10(\Delta Q) \sim ~&log10(\Delta forest) + s(\frac{E0}{Pa}) + s(Area) + s(Latitude) + s(Longitude) + \\
& s(years) + {forest~type} + {climate~type} + {assessment~type} + \\ & {hydrologic~regime} + \varepsilon
\end{aligned}$$

The results were analysed to identify:  
1. the significance of the different variables  
2. the direction of the categorical or shape of the smooth variables
