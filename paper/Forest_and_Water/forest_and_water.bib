Previous studies have suggested significant trends in rainfall, and these are amplified causing larger changes in streamflow. However, most of the previous analysis was based on annual time scales or modelled data and did not account for changes in land cover, which could interact with changes in climate. Climate data and streamflow data between 1970 and 2010 from 13 mostly forested small catchments (<250?km2) in Australia were analysed for trends. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend analysis, generalized additive mixed modelling and rainfall-runoff modelling were combined for the analysis. This indicates consistent increases in maximum temperature and varied decreases in rainfall. The streamflow in the studied catchments indicated small decreases in streamflow, which amplified observed trends in the rainfall. In general, overall decreases are much smaller than suggested in earlier research.},

   journal = {Forest Ecology and Management},
   volume = {143},
   number = {1},
   pages = {13-26},
   abstract = {There is a well-documented empirical relationship between stand age and water yield for mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forested catchments in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia. Catchments covered with old-growth stands of mountain ash yield almost twice the amount of water annually as those covered with re-growth stands aged 25 years. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic hydro-ecologic explanation for this phenomenon. We measured leaf area index (LAI), sapwood area index (SAI) and various water balance components in several mountain ash stands, ranging in age between 5 and 240 years. Sap flow measurements show that sap velocity does not vary appreciably amongst stands of different ages, but a systematic decline in SAI with age produces a concomitant decrease in stand transpiration. The decline in overstory SAI is accompanied by a decline in overstory LAI. Understory LAI increases as the overstory LAI decreases, but this layer transpires at only about 63% of the mountain ash rate on a per unit leaf area basis. Hence, while total stand LAI decreases are modest over time, the trend is for a significant decline in total stand transpiration as the forest ages. Rainfall interception also declined over time and there was some indication that interception per unit leaf area also declined. Such reductions can be explained by lesser turbulent mixing and elevated humidity around the bulk of the leaf area in the mature forest. There were small decreases in forest floor evaporation through time, though this only accounted for about 5–8% of the site water balance. Our water balance measurements agree qualitatively with empirical water yield relationships developed for mountain ash forests, though the magnitudes of change differ.},

   pages = {3520-3530},
   abstract = {Abstract Nearly half of recent decades' global forest loss occurred in the Amazon and Cerrado (tropical savanna) biomes of Brazil, known as the arc of deforestation. Despite prior analysis in individual river basins, a generalizable empirical understanding of the effect of deforestation on streamflow across this region is lacking. We frame land use change in Brazil as a natural experiment and draw on in situ and remote sensing evidence in 324 river basins covering more than 3 × 106 km2 to estimate streamflow changes caused by deforestation and agricultural development between 1950 and 2013. Deforestation increased dry season low flow by between 4 and 10 percentage points (relative to the forested condition), corresponding to a regional- and time-averaged rate of increase in specific streamflow of 1.29 mm/year2, equivalent to a 4.08 km3/year2 increase, assuming a stationary climate. In conjunction with rainfall and temperature variations, the net (observed) average increase in streamflow over the same period was 0.76 mm/year2, or 2.41 km3/year2. Thus, net increases in regional streamflow in the past half century are 58% of those that would have been experienced with deforestation given a stationary climate. This study uses a causal empirical analysis approach novel to the water sciences to verify the regional applicability of prior basin-scale studies, provides a proof of concept for the use of observational causal identification methods in the water sciences, and demonstrates that deforestation masks the streamflow-reducing effects of climate change in this region.},

   abstract = {Tree restoration is an effective way to store atmospheric carbon and mitigate climate change. However, large-scale tree-cover expansion has long been known to increase evaporation, leading to reduced local water availability and streamflow. More recent studies suggest that increased precipitation, through enhanced atmospheric moisture recycling, can offset this effect. Here we calculate how 900 million hectares of global tree restoration would impact evaporation and precipitation using an ensemble of data-driven Budyko models and the UTrack moisture recycling dataset. We show that the combined effects of directly enhanced evaporation and indirectly enhanced precipitation create complex patterns of shifting water availability. Large-scale tree-cover expansion can increase water availability by up to 6% in some regions, while decreasing it by up to 38% in others. There is a divergent impact on large river basins: some rivers could lose 6% of their streamflow due to enhanced evaporation, while for other rivers, the greater evaporation is counterbalanced by more moisture recycling. Several so-called hot spots for forest restoration could lose water, including regions that are already facing water scarcity today. Tree restoration significantly shifts terrestrial water fluxes, and we emphasize that future tree-restoration strategies should consider these hydrological effects.},

Whilst such analyses are widespread in hydrologic practice and research, attention is rarely given to the problems of heteroscedacity, seasonality, serial correlation, and non-normally distributed variates. Each of these problems can potentially invalidate the basic assumptions upon which traditional statistical methods are based. We describe methods to contend with some of these problems and apply them to mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forested catchments in the Maroondah Basin, south-eastern Australia. A seasonal regression model with lag-one auto-regressive (AR1) error was developed to predict monthly streamflow at treated catchments based on streamflow data from a control catchment. It is particularly well-suited to situations where little pre-treatment data is available. Differences between observed and predicted streamflow were used to quantify the effect of forest treatment on streamflow. Results from two catchment groups broadly matched the trend predicted by a previous regional model, with 2–3 year increases in streamflow, followed by decreases over the following one or two decades. A third group of catchments also showed initial increases, but expected subsequent decreases in streamflow were offset by the flow-increasing effects of insect infestations.},

   abstract = {Water yields increased after logging by 150-250 mm per year in small catchments of moist old-growth eucalypt at Karuah in central New South Wales. The magnitude of this initial increase was directly related to the percentage of the catchment logged (29-79%). Where substantial vegetation removal took place in less than 20% of one catchment no increased water yield was observed. Water yields began to decline in all catchments 2-3 years after logging as regrowth eucalypts became established, and the rate of this decline was related to the mean stocking rate of eucalypt regeneration during the next 4 years. This water yield decline exceeded 250 mm in the sixth year after logging in the catchment with the highest stocking of regeneration and the highest regrowth basal area. Water yields in this catchment had declined to levels significantly below pre-logging levels by this time, supporting the notion that regrowth evapotranspiration had begun to exceed that of the old-growth forest. Patterns of declining water yield in the other catchments suggest that yields in some may also decline below pre-logging levels as regrowth evapotranspiration increases in line with increases in the basal area of the regrowth forest. Further study is required to determine the magnitude and duration of water yield reductions in these regrowth catchments, and to quantify the eucalypt growth rates and stand conditions responsible for the reductions. Nevertheless, these early results are consistent with water yield changes observed in mountain ash forest in Victoria, and support the concept of greater water use by a rapidly regenerating forest.},

   abstract = {Water yields in a regrowth eucalypt forest were found to increase initially and then to decline below pre-treatment levels during the 16-year period which followed the logging of a moist old-growth eucalypt forest in Eastern Australia. Both regrowth and old-growth stands were dominated by Sydney Blue Gum (Eucalyptus saligna Smith) and Silvertop Stringybark (Eucalyptus laevopinea R. Baker). Using a paired-catchment approach we observed significant reductions in five of six gauged catchments, and were able to associate their magnitude with forest growth rate, canopy cover and soil depth. Regular yield declines were interrupted for a period in some catchments, possibly due to foliar insect attack. Yield reductions of up to a maximum 600 mm per year in logged and regenerated areas were in accord with water yield reductions observed in Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans F.J. Muell.) regeneration in Victoria. This study therefore represents the first confirmation of these Maroondah Mountain Ash results in another forest type that has also undergone eucalypt-to-eucalypt succession. Baseflow analysis indicated that baseflow and stormflow both increased after logging, with stormflow increases dominant in catchments with shallower soils. The lower runoff observed when the regenerating forest was aged 13-16 years was principally a consequence of lower baseflow.},

   abstract = {Summary The Coalburn research catchment (1.5km2) in Kielder Forest, Northern England, is a long-term project to study the effect of upland afforestation on hydrology. There is now a unique 45-year record; making it Britain’s longest running forest hydrology research catchment. The site was instrumented in 1967, ploughed and planted in 1972/73 and the trees have now reached maturity. Hourly meteorological data have been measured since 1993 and these have enabled hydrological simulations to be carried out using the Shetran model for the period 1993–2011. The results from this work show that after ploughing there was an increase of around 50–100mm in annual streamflow compared with the original upland grassland vegetation. However, the mature trees now show a decrease of around 250–300mm in the annual streamflow compared with the original vegetation and a decrease of around 350mm in the annual streamflow compared with when the site was ploughed. The simulation results show very clearly the non-stationary nature of the catchment during 1993–2011 with an annual increase in intercepted evaporation and a decrease in discharge as the trees grow. Simulation results also show that peak discharges are higher for a cover of smaller trees compared with taller trees. However, the results suggest that the bigger the event the smaller is the difference, i.e. there is absolute convergence for the two different tree scenarios at higher discharges. The study shows how modelling can compensate for data deficiencies, to maximise outcomes. As a rare example of long-term analysis of non-stationary catchment behaviour it also provides real evidence of change that would otherwise have had to be inferred theoretically.},

   abstract = {Abstract Streamflows were measured in two Pinus radiata plantation catchments and one native eucalypt forest catchment in Canobolas State forest from 1999 to 2007. In 2002/2003, clearfall harvesting of 43·2 and 40·3% of two plantation catchments occurred, respectively. Water yields increased by 54 mm (52%), 71 mm (35%) and 50 mm (19%) in the first three years post-harvest in treated catchment A and by 103 mm (118%), 157 mm (82%) and 119 mm (48%) in treated catchment B relative to the native forest control catchment. In the fourth post-harvest water year annual rainfall was only 488 mm, which resulted in negligible run-off in all catchments, regardless of forest cover. In both plantation catchments, monthly streamflows increased significantly (p = 0·01, p < 0·001) due to a significant increase in baseflows (p < 0·001) after harvesting. Monthly stormflows were not significantly affected by harvesting. Flow duration curve analyses indicated a variable response between the two plantation catchments. Treated catchment A was converted from an ephemeral stream flowing 42% of the time pre-harvest to a temporary stream flowing 82% of the time post-harvest. These changes occurred throughout all seasons of the year but were most pronounced during summer and autumn when baseflows were maintained post-harvest but were not observed under native forest or mature pine plantations. By contrast, flow duration increased in treated catchment B from 12% of the time pre-harvest to 38% of the time post-harvest with the greatest changes measured during the winter and spring months when streamflow would normally occur under native forest conditions. These observations have important implications for the development of models of plantation water use to be utilized in water resource planning in Australia. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   journal = {Forest Ecology and Management},
   volume = {306},
   pages = {107-117},
   abstract = {Eucalypts are commonly planted hardwoods worldwide and Eucalyptus dominated forests naturally grow in the headwaters of many Australian water supply catchments. The hydrological effects of disturbances have been extensively reported for one species, E. regnans (Mountain Ash). The typical response to disturbance is unusual in that following an initial increase, with heavy seed dispersal and rapid regeneration, streamflow from these forests is greatly reduced. In New South Wales (NSW), native forests are dominated by different Eucalyptus species that typically grow in mixed-species and mixed-age stands that regenerate less vigorously. In this study the long term streamflow records from the six Yambulla catchments in southeastern NSW were analysed to assess the relative effects of wildfires, integrated logging operations and subsequent mixed species eucalypt forest regeneration on catchment hydrology. In all five treated catchments an increase in total streamflow, baseflow and stormflow was detected following the 1979 wildfire and/or integrated logging activities that occurred at various intervals. A subsequent reduction of streamflow to below that of a mature stand was not detected in three of the catchments but was detected in the two that had been subjected to integrated logging followed by a wildfire, and a wildfire followed by salvage logging, respectively. The reduction, however, was minor and short-lived in each case meaning that overall there was a cumulative increase in streamflow in the post-disturbance period. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that catchment-scale hydrological responses to disturbance of mixed species eucalypt forests do not follow the unusual response often reported in wet Mountain Ash forests. This has important implications for the modelling and management of mixed species eucalypt hydrology.},

   journal = {Journal of Hydrology},
   volume = {412-413},
   pages = {133-140},
   abstract = {Summary Competition for water resources in Australia’s Murray Darling Basin has resulted in plans to account for water used by various land use change activities including plantation forests. To date generalised forest conversion models have been used to assess the likely impacts of future afforestation. These models are a useful starting point but do not account for forest age or silvicultural intervention such as thinning. A twenty year record from the Red Hill paired catchment study was analysed to show that forest age is a significant factor in determining the streamflow response to afforestation. Compared to the Kileys Run pasture catchment, streamflow in the Red Hill catchment afforested with Pinus radiata plantations steadily declined, particularly after age 6years when stand basal area rapidly increased. Mixed effect model analysis indicated that over the first 20years of the rotation the mean annual impact of afforestation with pines was 155mm. The modelled impact peaked at 211mm in year 14 prior to thinning. Thinning at age 14years had a significant positive effect on streamflow that has persisted for at least 6years. Drought conditions coupled with a process of recharging the catchment soils contributed to a delayed response to thinning. Factors such as forest age and thinning should be incorporated into models used in water resources planning to more accurately predict the hydrological effects of afforestation.},
